                <p>Dimitrov is the most successful Bulgarian male tennis player to date, both in terms of ranking reached—as of 2017 he is the only Bulgarian tennis player ever to be ranked inside the top 10 ATP Singles—and prize money won, being the only male Bulgarian player to reach US$1m[2] and later $10m. Dimitrov is also the first (and only) Bulgarian male tennis player to win an ATP title in singles (after he won in October 2013 at Stockholm) and reach a final in doubles (in 2011) as well as the only Bulgarian male player to reach the third round or better at a Grand Slam tournament. Dimitrov is also the first Bulgarian to qualify for, and later win, the ATP Finals.[3] He has won 8 ATP singles titles to date. Prior to his professional career, Dimitrov enjoyed a successful junior career, in which he held the world No. 1 ranking and won consecutive grand slam boys' singles titles at the 2008 Wimbledon Championships and the 2008 US Open, at the former he defeated future men's doubles No. 1 player Henri Kontinen in the final.</p>

                <p>Dimitrov started his 2018 campaign in Brisbane, where he was the defending champion and top seed. He started from the second round with hard three set win against the home favourite and wild card John Millman, then overcame with another three setter the British number 2 Kyle Edmund. Dimitrov was eliminated in the semi-finals by the third seed and eventual champion Nick Kyrgios. The Bulgarian played in the doubles as well. Paired with Ryan Harrison, he reached the semi-finals, before withdrawing. Having started his campaign at Australian Open with a couple of wins against qualifiers Dennis Novak and Mackenzie McDonald, Dimitrov was drawn against Andrey Rublev who knocked him out in the second round of US Open just a few months ago. At the Round of 32 of the Australian Open 2018 he won 3-1 against Andrey Rublev and will face Nick Kyrgios in the Round of 16.</p>
            </article>
            <article>As a child, Dimitrov was coached by his father, Dimitar, at Tennis Club Haskovo. As his talent became more apparent he started to receive coaching from abroad, most notably from Spaniard Pato Alvarez, who has also coached Britain's Andy Murray. Alvarez has reportedly said that Dimitrov is the best 17 year old he has coached. Around the time of his success at the 2009 ABN AMRO in Rotterdam, Dimitrov formally began a coaching relationship with Peter Lundgren, former coach of world No. 1s Marat Safin and Roger Federer. Lundgren has also been quick to praise Dimitrov, saying that "he is better than Federer was at his age."[104] In June 2010, Dimitrov ended his coaching relationship with Lundgren and was subsequently coached by Australian pro Peter McNamara.[105] Dimitrov and McNamara have ended their coaching relationship at the end of the 2011 season.[106] In 2012, Dimitrov was coached by Patrick Mouratoglou in an attempt to revive his fortunes.[107] On 26 November 2012, Dimitrov left the Patrick Mouratoglou Academy and has joined the Good to Great Tennis Academy in Sweden, which is run by ex-touring pros Magnus Norman, Nicklas Kulti, and Mikael Tillström. On 7 October 2013, Dimitrov announced on his Facebook page that he has hired Roger Rasheed (former coach of Gaël Monfils, Jo-Wilifred Tsonga and Lleyton Hewitt) to be his new coach.[108] On 7 July 2015 Dimitrov announced via Twitter that he would be parting ways with coach Roger Rasheed.[109] On 25 September 2015, Dimitrov announced he had hired Juan Martín del Potro's former coach Franco Davín,[110] but they parted ways in the first half of 2016.[111] Since June 2016 Dimitrov has been coached by Daniel Vallverdu, a former coach of Andy Murray, during which tenure Murray won 2 Grand Slam Titles. Dimitrov has credited Vallverdu with his upturn in form during the 2017 season and has mentioned several times during interviews and during his thank you speech, following his win of the 2017 ATP Finals, that he is very thankful for his success to his coaching team and particularly Vallverdu. Dimitrov also stated numerous times through the season, that Valverdu changed his mentality towards the game and is the main factor for the way he plays against top ten players.</article> <a href="#top">On top </a>

            <article>
                <p>Nicholas Hilmy Kyrgios[2] (/ˈkɪriɒs/ KIRR-ee-oss;[3] Greek: Νικόλαος Χίλμη "Νίκος" Κύργιος;[pronunciation?] born 27 April 1995) is an Australian professional tennis player who is currently ranked world No.17 in men's singles by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP).[4] He won the boys' singles event at the 2013 Australian Open and the boys' doubles event at the 2013 Wimbledon Championships. Kyrgios' biggest achievements are reaching the quarterfinals of the 2014 Wimbledon Championships—defeating ATP number 1 Rafael Nadal and Richard Gasquet en route—and the quarterfinals of the 2015 Australian Open. Kyrgios is the second player after fellow Aussie Lleyton Hewitt to beat Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic in their first meeting.[5] He has been controversial at times, for example admitting in 2017 that he had "probably" tanked at eight tournaments during his professional career, because on certain days he’d "rather be doing something else than playing tennis.</p>

            <article>
                <p>In his first tournament of the season at the 2018 Brisbane International, Kyrgios received a bye into the second round due to being the 3rd seed. In his first competitive match since the 2017 European Open, Kyrgios lost the 1st set against his compatriot, Matthew Ebden in a first-set tiebreak. However, he soon found his form and stormed into the quarterfinals through a hard-fought three set win. His next opponent would be Ukraine's Alexandr Dolgopolov. He once recovered from a slow start as he lost the first set, 6—1, to the crafty world no. 38. Like in his first match though, he found a way to power past the former world no. 12 and schedule a rematch of the Cincinnati Masters final against now world no. 3 and defending champion, Grigor Dimitrov. For the third match in a row, the Australian found himself a set down against the Bulgarian, who appeared set for a 3rd Brisbane final. Kyrgios, though, had other ideas blasting his way through the second set, 6—1 and forcing the decisive break out of Dimitrov in the third set to seal his 6th win out of 10 against top 3 opponents. In total, he would serve 19 aces in the semi-final encounter. He would play American Ryan Harrison in his first final on home soil after the American denied an all Australian final by seeing out wildcard and world no. 208, Alex De Minaur, who was appearing in his first ATP World tour semi-final. The one-time ATP titlist started brightly in the third match between the two as he had five break points in two of Kyrgios' first three service games. After failing to convert on any of these chances, the Australian pounced on his first opportunity to lead 4—3 and eventually see out the first set by 6 games to 4. From then on, Kyrgios stormed through the second set, breaking Harrison twice more to win his first title since Tokyo 2016. In by far his most convincing match of the tournament, Kyrgios returned back to the top 20, rising back to no. 17, narrowly missing out on a top 16 seeding at the upcoming Australian Open. At the 2018 Australian Open Round of 32 he defeated Jo-Wilfried Tsonga 7-6 4-6 7-6 7-6.</p>
            </article>
            <article>Kyrgios claims to not fear any opponent, and says he always plays aggressively.[63] Former British number one John Lloyd described watching Kyrgios as a "pleasure" because of "the mixture and the flair", adding that his character is one which attracts fans.[63] According to three-time Wimbledon champion John Newcombe, Kyrgios is an "exceptional talent" and "a real individual".[63] Nine-time Wimbledon doubles champion Todd Woodbridge stated in 2015 that despite Kyrgios' occasionally regrettable words and actions, he would mature over time.[63] He is constantly described as "box office". Paul Annacone, a former Top 15 tennis player and once coach to Roger Federer, said in 2017, "I think Nick is the most talented player since Roger jumped on the scene."[68] Kyrgios' main strength could be considered his serve; usually reaching higher or equal accuracy percentages of 75%. Nonetheless, he also has a tremendous and blasting forehand as well as a very consistent and dangerous backhand. Adding to his skills are an effective slice and an efficient net game. In spite of the fact that his game suits perfectly grass and hard courts (achieving great results in Wimbledon and the Australian Open), he reached his first ATP Tour final, on clay, in Estoril. The Economist has described Kyrgios as "electric-serving" but a "one-dimensional attacking" player.[69]</article>

            <h3>Rod Laver Arena</h3>

            <article>Rod Laver Arena has a seating capacity of 14,820, with a capacity of 15,400 for sports such as basketball, when extra seats are added around the court, and up to 16,200 for concerts with floor seating.[8] The arena currently attracts over 1.5 million visitors per year. The arena was the first in Australia to have a retractable roof venue, and it is the largest indoor arena in Australia without a permanent roof (not counting the 56,347 seat Docklands Stadium, also in Melbourne, which is classed as a stadium rather than an arena). It is also the second largest indoor arena in Australia behind the 21,032 capacity Sydney Super Dome. The arena's retractable roof allows competitors to continue play during rain or extreme heat. Rod Laver Arena is equipped with the Hawk-Eye electronic system which allows tennis players to challenge the umpire's decision on calls made throughout championships.From 1988 until 2007, the surface of the court at the Australian Open and on Rod Laver Arena was Rebound Ace, which was coloured green and played slowly. The surface was also blamed for many injuries in the Australian Open, with many players claiming that the surface became sticky in hot weather, making it difficult to play on. In 2008, the surface was changed to Plexicushion, which is coloured blue. The surface is similar in properties to DecoTurf, the surface used in the US Open. This has more cushioning and more "give" than Rebound Ace. The change of surfaces gained a mostly positive reaction from players, as the surface is said to be easier to play on than Rebound Ace.[citation needed] It has also had a temporary grass court in use, during the 1993 Davis Cup quarterfinals, 2001 Davis Cup final and the 2003 Davis Cup final.</article>
